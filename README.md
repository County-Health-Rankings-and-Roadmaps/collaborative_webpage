# CHR&R Community

This is a centralized hub for sharing resources related to measuring health determinants at the county level. 

## About CHR&R
County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) draws attention to why there are differences in health within and across communities. The program highlights policies and practices that can help everyone be as healthy as possible. CHR&R aims to grow a shared understanding of health, equity and the power of communities to improve health for all. This work is rooted in a long-term vision where all people and places have what they need to thrive.  

CHR&R is committed to creating resources and tools that support community-led efforts to accurately diagnose core problems, understand and account for historical context and implement evidence-informed solutions. CHR&R provides a snapshot of the health of nearly every county in the nation.
